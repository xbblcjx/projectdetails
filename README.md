Project:
Clearance Transaction Failures Prediction Project Description: Everyday the XXX platform clear 500k security transactions for 300 clients having 2500 accounts and settle 4 trillion of dollers of transaction value.The platform experience the failue, which results unsettle of 35 billion of dollers. This failue impact the clients's business and impact on financial health.
Goals:
Provide an analytical breakdown of failsAttempt to predict failures in the marketProvide a view to the FED to "daisy-chain" dependencies - within asset groups - and whether its increasing.
Method:
>Work with SMEs to create additional attributes for each transaction
>Build deep learning model in H2O opensource software
>analyze results
Role and Responsibility:
1.Product SME
2.Build deep learning model in H2O opensource software
Technology stack:
H2O,Python,Java
Algorithm:
1.H2O GLM (logistic regression)
2.Distributed Random Forrest (DRF)
3.Deep Learning(DL) packages
4.Generalized Boosting Machines(GBM).

*************************************************************
Project: User Interface Pattern mining.
Project description: User clustering based on their activity on the XXX (XXX XX XX ) platform. i.e classify users into functional groups  (managers, securities clearance, funds routing, triparty, bnym bridge etc.) but without defining the groups. Also classify the user based on the accounts they use for different activity. Classify which users are responsible for what accounts. Identify work patterns - i.e. users navigating a set of screens together.
Algorithm:
For classifying users Association Rule mining, Expectation Maximization (EM) based on Markov chains, Conceptual clustering, COBWEB and Category Utility.
Technology stack:R, Python, Java,
Role and responsibility: SME, Developer.
