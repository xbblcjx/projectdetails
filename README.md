Project:
Clearance Transaction Failures Prediction Project Description: Everyday the XXX platform clear 500k security transactions for 300 clients having 2500 accounts and settle 4 trillion of dollers of transaction value.The platform experience the failue, which results unsettle of 35 billion of dollers. This failue impact the clients's business and impact on financial health.
Goals:
Provide an analytical breakdown of failsAttempt to predict failures in the marketProvide a view to the FED to "daisy-chain" dependencies - within asset groups - and whether its increasing.
Method:
>Work with SMEs to create additional attributes for each transaction
>Build deep learning model in H2O opensource software
>analyze results
